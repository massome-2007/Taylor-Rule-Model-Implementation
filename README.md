# Taylor Rule Model Implementation
Explanation:

Developed a Taylor Rule-based model to analyze central bank interest rate decisions in response to economic conditions. The model uses key parameters such as the inflation target, neutral interest rate, and weights on inflation and output gaps. By simulating inflation and output gap data over a specified number of time periods, the model computes the interest rate decisions using the Taylor Rule formula. The results are visualized using a line plot, demonstrating the central bank's response to economic fluctuations.

Key Features:
Inflation Target: The central bank's desired inflation rate.

Neutral Interest Rate: The interest rate that is neither stimulative nor restrictive.

Weights on Inflation and Output Gaps: Parameters indicating the central bank's responsiveness to deviations in inflation and output.

Simulated Data: Randomly generated inflation and output gap data to simulate economic conditions.
